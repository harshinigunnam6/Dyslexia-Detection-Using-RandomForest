# ðŸ§  Dyslexia Detection Using Machine Learning

An intelligent system that detects signs of dyslexia from written input using Optical Character Recognition (OCR), linguistic feature analysis, and a Random Forest classifier. The goal is to support early screening and intervention for individuals showing signs of reading and writing difficulties.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project extracts text from user-written input (typed or handwritten), analyzes it for spelling, grammar, and phonetic patterns, and predicts the likelihood of dyslexia using a trained machine learning model. The tool is designed to be simple, accessible, and adaptable for educational or clinical use.
